# NWEN241 Assignment 4

This assignment shows an implementation of a simple database table using C++ programming constructs. 

It was one of my first instances using C++ and taught me basic conceptual knowledge and fundamentals of the language. Examples of these are structs, namespaces and abstact functions. 

This basic database represented movie information and contained four fields, namely, *id, title, year *and *director*. The database should be able to load in and save data appropriatley, with the data seperated by commas. Functions such as 'update' and 'remove' are added in order to edit an existing record.
